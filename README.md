Welcome, #Devs() :wave: to the Learning Journey :mortar_board: of "Web Scraping" which is one of the most important concepts of "Data Warehouse and Mining (DWM)". We will deep dive into all foremost concepts and explore all modules that will help you at Academic Level and Professional levels. But Before that, you are Wondering Why DWM :thinking: ? Let's Understand it from the Scratch :innocent: :-

  <summary><b>What is Data :page_with_curl:?</b></summary>
  <p>
    Basically Collection of Information is known as <b><u>"Data"</u></b>. Let's Understand Types of Data in Brief:-
    
   - In Terms of Machine
   - In General Terms

  Data is Inclusion of multiple fields such as Quantities, Information, Graphs, Measurment, Observation, Facts, Numbers, and much more. Let's Understand These both Scenario One by One.

  <h4>1. In Terms of Machine</h4>

  There are Two types of Data for the Given Scenario:-

   - Analog Data (e.g.:- Photocopies, Audiotapes, etc.)
   - Digital Data (e.g.:- Digital Thermometre, Symbols, etc.) 

  <i>Nature</i> is <b>'Analog'</b>, While a <i>Computer</i> is <b>'Digital'</b>. All Digital Data are stored as <b>'Binary Digits'</b>. One of the most common Data Type is <b>'Text'</b>, also referred to as <em>'Character String'</em>.
  
  <h4>2. In General Terms</h4>
  
  There are Two main flavours of Data stated below:-
  
  - Qualitative Data (or Categorical Data)
    - Binomial Data (Binary Data)
    - Nominal Data (Unordered Data or Named Data)
    - Ordinal Data (Ordered Data)
  - Quantitative Data (or Numerical Data)
    - Discrete Data
    - Continous Data

  Defination of each term was stated below:-
  
  <b>i. Qualitative Data (or Categorical Data):-</b>
  The Data which Deals with Numbers and Things you can Measure Objectively. <b>for e.g.:-</b> Dimension such as Height, Prices, Areas and Volumes, etc. <br/>
  
  <b>a. Binomial Data (Binary Data):-</b>
  Binary Data places things in one of the mutually exclusive categories:- Right/Wrong, True/False, or Accept/Reject, etc. <br/>
  
  <b>b. Nominal Data (Unordered Data or Named Data):-</b>
  We assign the individual items to named categories that do not have an implicit or natural value or rank. If we look out the box of colors and records of colors on each worksheet that would be Nominal Data. <br/>
  
  <b>c. Ordinal Data (Ordered Data):-</b>
  Data in which items are assigned to categories that do have some kind of implicit or natural order. Such as "Short, Medium or Tall". Scale of 1 to 10. Which defines 10 is better tha 9. This lies under Ordinal Data Category.
  
  <b>ii. Quantitative Data (or Numerical Data):-</b>
  Data which Deals with Characteristics and Discriptors that can't be easily measured, but can Observed Subjectively. <b>for e.g.:-<b> Taste, Attractivness, Colors, etc. <br/>
  
  <b>a. Discrete Data:-</b>
  Discrete Data is a Count that can't be made more precise. Typically it involves integers. For Instance:- Number of Children in your Family is Discrete Data, because we are counting whole Indivisible entries <b>for e.g.:-</b> You can't have 1.3 Pets, etc. <br/>
  
  <b>b. Continous Data:-</b>
  Continous Data on the other hand, could be divided and reduced to finer and finer levels. <b>for e.g.:-</b> Height of a Kid at progressively and more precise.

  <summary><b>What is Data Warehouse :floppy_disk:?</b></summary>
  <p>
    A <b>"Data Warehouse (DW)"</b> is a process for collecting and managing data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights. A Data Warehouse is typically used to connect and analyze busincess data from heterogeneous sources. The Data warehouse is the core of the BI systems which is built for Data Analysis and Reporting. 
    
   <b>Data Warehouse (DW) Systems is also known by the following Name:- </b>
  1. Decision Support System (DSS)
  2. Executive Information System
  3. Managment Information System
  4. Bussiness Inteligence Solution
  5. Analytic Application
  
  <b>How Data warehouse Works?</b>
  
  A Data warehouse works as a Central repository where information arrives from one or more data sources. Data flows into a data warehouse from the transactional system and other relational data bases. and Data maybe:-
  
  <b>i. Structured Data:- </b>
  It's based in RDBMS (Relational DataBase Managment System). Versioning over Tuples, Rows, Tables. It is very Robust. Structure Query allow complex joining. It is very difficult to scale DB Schema. <br/>
  
  <b>i. Semi-Structured Data:- </b>
  It's based on XML (Extensible Mark-up Language)/ RDF (Resource Description Framework). New Technology, not very spread. Queries over anonymous nodes are possible. Versioning over Tuples and Graph is possible. <br/>
  
  <b>i. Unstructured Data:- </b>
  It's based on Character and Binary Data. Versioning as whole. Only the texture Queries is possible. and it is more scalable. <br/>
    
   <b>Who needs Data warehouse?</b>
   
   DW (Data warehouse) is needed for all types of Users like:
   - Decision makers who rely on mass amount of Data.
   - Users who use customized, complex processes to obtain information from multiple data sources.
   - It is also used by the people who want simple technology to access the data.
   - It also essential for those people who want a systematic approach for making decisions.
   - Data warehouse is a first step If you want to discover 'hidden patterns' of data-flows and groupings.

  <summary><b>What is Data Mining :hammer:?</b></summary>
  <p>
    <b>"Data Mining"</b> is the process of analyzing massive volumes of Data to discover Business Intelligence that helps companies Solve Problem, Migrate Risks, and Seize New Opportunities.
    
   This branch of data science derives its name from the similarities between searching for valuable information in a large database and mining a mountain for ore. Both processes require sifting through tremendous amounts of material to find hidden value. Data mining can answer business questions that traditionally were too time consuming to resolve manually.
   
   <b>Key Concepts for the Data Mining Process:-</b>
   
   1. Data Cleansing and Preparation
   2. Machine Learning (ML)
   3. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   4. Association Rule Mining (ARM) Learning
   5. Clustering
   6. Classification
   7. Regression
   8. Data Warehousing (DW)
   9. Data Analytics (DA)
   
   <b>Advantages of Data Mining:-</b>
   - Increasing revenue.
   - Understanding customer segments and preferences.
   - Acquiring new customers.
   - Improving cross-selling and up-selling.
   - Monitoring operational performance.
   - and much more...

  <summary><b>Why we are Studying Data Warehouse and Mining (DWM) :wrench:?</b></summary>
  <p>
    <b>"Data Warehouse"</b> allows Users to access Critical Data from the Number of Sources in a Single Places. Therefore, it Saves user's Time of retrieving Datafrom multiple Sources. 
    
   While <b>"Data Mining"</b> helps to generate Actionable Strategies built on Data Insights.
   
   Thus, This was the major reason Data Warehouse and Mining (DWM) plays crucial Role in Data Science Field.

  <summary><b>What exactly is "Web Scraping" ðŸ¤”?</b></summary>
  <p>
    Basically <b>"Web Scraping"</b> is the process of exctracting Content and Data from the Website. Which can be use for further Analysis Process :chart_with_upwards_trend:. 
    
   Web Scraping tools are Software (basically, i.e. Bots) programmed to sift through databases and extract information. A variety of bot types are used, many being fully customizable to:
   
   <b>1. Recognize Unique Site Structure Such as HTML Structure, JS Structure, and many more.</b>
   
   <b>2. Extract and Transform New Content</b>
   
   <b>3. Extract Data from APIs and ASP Pages</b>
   
   <b>4. Stored Scraped Data for further Analysis and much more</b>
   
   Thus, this was a small introduction for <b>"Web Scraping"</b>.
